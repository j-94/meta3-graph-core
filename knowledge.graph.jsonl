🟦 TINY GRAPH ENGINE (Meta3 Core)
   "Abstracting everything away in the graph delta."

USAGE:
  echo '{ "nodes": [], "links": [...] }' | tiny_graph

PROTOCOL:
  - Input: valid JSON Object with "nodes" and "links".
  - Link "creates" | "modifies": Writes 'content' to 'target' (File Path).
  - Link "executes" | "runs": Runs 'target' as Shell Command.

EXAMPLE:
  {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "GOAL" },
      { "id": "FILE:script.py" }
    ],
    "links": [
      { "source": "GOAL", "target": "FILE:script.py", "type": "creates", "content": "print('Alive')" }
    ]
